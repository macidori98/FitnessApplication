FitnessApplication

The FitnessApplication application can be used by trainers as well as those who want to train.
Everyone has to register and when they register they have to choose whether they want to train or use the application as a trainer.
Coaches can upload their own video (s) to help ordinary people develop.
Trainees can choose between muscle groups and what they want to workout that day. They can see the list of couches, and they can watch their workout tutorials.
